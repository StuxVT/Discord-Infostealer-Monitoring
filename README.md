# SonicGlyde-Discord-Malware

A few of my friends got hit by this malware. Decided to reverse it to see what is under the hood.

virus.7z includes an electron-based credential grabber which steals discord tokens and browser data
 - it also includes a decrypted copy of the grabber source, with hardcoded C2 info
 - password: `stux`

It is being distributed via a manual phishing in discord DMs using the stolen accounts. Linking users to: `https://sonicglyde.com/` to download a fake game which is the aforementioned malware.

C2 server appears to be a proxy for telegram bot based on screenshots sent by the criminal to victims.

Current sha256hash of "SonicGlyde.rar" hosted by the site: `C2950FB320332E9D0DD72BA024B3792A5A0476E87EA99BD3C607FA75102E2EA4`
Last checked: `1710592073` (epoch timestamp)
Verified no change in C2 or functionality. Likely changed due to discord CDN expiry.
One-Line change at top of file doesn't seem to change overall functionality: 
`process.env.ComSpec = 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe';`

## spam_c2.py Features

- Generates random user and system metadata.
- Simulates the posting of new injections, valid tokens, browser data, and additional malicious endpoints to the live C2.
- Simulates the following additional endpoints:
  - `2fa-enable`: Sending data when two-factor authentication is being enabled.
  - `2fa-disable`: Sending data when two-factor authentication is being disabled.
  - `password-change`: Sending data when the user's password is being changed.
  - `email-change`: Sending data when the user's email is being changed.
