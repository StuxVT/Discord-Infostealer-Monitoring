# SonicGlyde-Discord-Malware

A few of my friends got hit by this malware. Decided to reverse it to see what is under the hood.

.\virus_src includes downloads to the full source, dated by most recent update.
 - Virus is an electron project, so I've extracted the relevant archives
 - I've also done the work of deobfuscating some of the JS, and pulled the unencrypted sources from the
    payload, and stage-2 files from the server.
 - password: `stux`

It is being distributed via a manual phishing in discord DMs using the stolen accounts. Linking users to: `https://sonicglyde.com/` to download a fake game which is the aforementioned malware.

C2 server appears to be a proxy for telegram bot based on screenshots sent by the criminal to victims.
